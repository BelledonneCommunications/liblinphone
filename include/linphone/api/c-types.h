 * The #LinphoneCore object can take the initiative to request authentication information
 * when needed to the application through the authentication_requested() callback of it's #LinphoneCoreCbs.
 *
 * The application can respond to this information request later using
 * linphone_core_add_auth_info(). This will unblock all pending authentication
